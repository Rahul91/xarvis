Ah!, finally GSoC Registration time for students are coming to an end. And hopesand  dreams of thousands of students, are on stake as working for some big orgs can come true in real life. But getting a proposal approved by the mentoring organisations is not a easy task, especially if you are working with big orgs, like Gnome, gnu, wikimedia, the Linux foundation etc. First you have to start by fixing abug, which is not a easy task, believe me, i have gone through this stage, the presure is ennormous, and also you have to do in a fix limited span of time. After that there comes the big task of writing a proposal, which is again not a easy task, diferent orgs have there different template designed, so that they can easily evaluate the proposals, as working for wikimedia, i got a simple template and then you just have to get started.
Most of the ideas proposed are from the ideapage of that org, but you just cant copy the whole stuff and paste in your proposal, you have to be specific about your idea and how you are willing to execute what ever is your idea, with proper timeline and phases.
Also in midst of all these, proper communication is also very important, you have to on IRC, mailing-list, and in regular contact with mentors and admins. Even all these things does not guarantees the approval of your proposal, so the cool thing would be to relax, just try to give your best, be in contact with your mentors and try to improve your final proposal.
