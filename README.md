Suit of Ironman is Jarvis, being a big fan, I named my blog similar to it, and there has to be a "X" since it is something related to technology.

Xarvis is a technical blog and the articles are maily on some open source technology, some tool or some language.
Although not many read my blog, but never the less, writing a blog is a good habit and I will continue to do so.
