 YES FOSS ...

WHAT IS FOSS?
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) are softwares where it is possible to see and change the software codes that make it work, but the community who developed it actually encourage it and rely on this philosophy to see the software spread and grow beyond its original creators. 
The nature of FOSS development practices means that some tools are extremely professional and even exceed the functionality of proprietary solutions. This is possible to see in applications such as Firefox for Web browsing, or Thunderbird for email.

WHY FOSS?
Open source projects usually have a large and welcoming community around them. Just look at the ubuntu community; its great.
Open source software tends to be more secure. The more eyes watching the code, the more security holes get noticed and fixed. Linux is better and more secured constructed from the beginning.
And now the best part its FREE.... :)

CONCLUSION-

If you feel that proprietary software are powerful, then tell me, how they can be powerful if they don’t respect the freedom of its users. The users are bounded by ropes there. They are spied, restricted to upgrades and even bounded to use the features. You don’t have any freedom to modify, distribute the software or even the see the code else you will be caught doing illegal actions.

“Be a Programmer in Real sense, else use Proprietary Software. The choice is all yours “

Happy Coding :)
