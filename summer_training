The dgplug Summer Training is back '14

The #dgplug Summer Training is back again this year, started this week, it had more then 150 members in the initial days. This Summer training is however different from any other training, conducted on IRC(Internet Relay Chat) and surely one of a kind, the summer training aims mainly on python and FOSS(Free and Open Source Software) and Real-world project experience.

 

This training is conducted on freenode network and #dgplug channel, can be accessed by any IRC client, chatzilla and Xchat being the most famous ones. I personally use chatzilla as IRC Client. Typically the students are from Durgapur and Kolkata, however there are many students from different parts of India as well as abroad. The class usually starts at 18:30 IST and mainly conducted by Kushal Das (nick- kushal) CPython Developer and works in Redhat, Pune, India. Also others moderators are Sayan Choudhary(nick - sayan), Ratan Debnath (rtnpro), Chandan Kumar and Eijah.


Highlight of this summer training being interactions with the develpores, talks given by various Up stream Developers and online communcations atticates. This is my second year in this Training, last year i could not complete it because of Placement and studies issues, this year i have another problem, its the damn job training starting next month, although i will try my level best to continue my classes.

The only problem that the class have (according to me) is that the no. of studentsparticipating decrease day by day, and only 10-20 students complete there training fully, may be this is because not everybody can grasp to the new things they are learning also the pace the class goes with presents a little problem but the main problem being the students itself, they grows the tendency of not asking question and gradually the lose there interest too, else everything related with this training si just awesome.
